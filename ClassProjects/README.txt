These projects are all projects done for class credit.

Froggy is a simple avoidance game. Playing as a small frog, you avoid larger frogs while "consuming" smaller ones. 
All classes being in the same file is a consequence of our turn in system. Involves interface built functional style lists,
game logic, and input/output.

Centipede is a functional representation of the arcade game Centipede. Inloves graphics, folding over lists, and game logic.

Hexagon is a semi-functional representation of a hexagon color picker, as sometimes seen on websites. Includes hexagons of up 6 hexagon "diameters."
This was done in high school before I entirely understood the concept of functional programming, and as such, is largely done from a object oriented
design standpoint.
