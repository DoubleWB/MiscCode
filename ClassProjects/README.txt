These projects are all projects done for class credit.

Centipede is a functional representation of the arcade game Centipede. Inloves graphics, folding over lists, and game logic.

Hexagon is a semi-functional representation of a hexagon color picker, as sometimes seen on websites. Includes hexagons of up 6 hexagon "diameters."
This was done in high school before I entirely understood the concept of functional programming, and as such, is largely done from a object oriented
design standpoint.
