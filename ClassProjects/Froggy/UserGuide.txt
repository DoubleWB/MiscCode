-------------

You assume the body of a young frog named Pepe.

The object of the game is to eat all other frogs
on the screen without being eaten.

If Pepe is bigger than another frog, he will eat it,
otherwise, he will be eaten himself and the game will end.

Once Pepe becomes the largest frog in the swamp, the game ends in
victory.


Control Pepe by clicking the location you wish him to travel to.

The further away from Pepe you click, the faster he will travel.

If Pepe goes to the left or right boundary, he will appear on the other side.

If Pepe goes to the top or bottom boundary, he will stop at that boundary.

Good luck!
